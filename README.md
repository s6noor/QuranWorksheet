# Quran Worksheet
Create a simple worksheet for teachers and students to learn any Surah of the Quran and add notations/notes.

User Input = Surah Number

Using the Surah number, quickly create a worksheet with the following:
  First page with Tafsir of the selected surah
  Each subsequent page contains one ayah and its translation from the Clear Quran
  Blank space is left for the student/learner to add translation of words, annotate and write more information about ayahs
  
  
Future work:
- Make the code modulr to ask for any tafseer or translation. 
- right now it outputs Uthmani codex and uses the font available on your computer. Future work should be done to make this process more robust.
- create a method to generate different outputs like word, pdf etc.
